            To get started, go to the ‘Records’ screen and choose the button below 
            to record an observation. An observation is a one-off recording of a 
            Giant Pink Slug sighting at a particular location.
        <p>

        <button class="fab-button" (click)="onClickedNewRecord(DATASETNAME_OBSERVATION)">
            <img class="fab-button__img" src="assets/imgs/fab-eye.png" alt="Koala Opportunistic Observation">
            <span class="fab-button__text">Record an observation</span>
        </button>

        <p>
            For each observation, please detail the type of observation, whether it is an observation of one 
            or more animals or sign of the animal’s presence from the distinctive trail marks left on smooth barked eucalypts. 
        </p>
        <!-- TODO: Insert image of giant pink slug – to be supplied by client -->
        <!-- TODO: Insert image of slug trail on tree trunk – to be supplied by client  -->
        
        <p>
            For observations where you have multiple slugs on different substrates, please record a separate 
            observation for each substrate type (tree trunk, road, leaf litter, rock, etc.). This will help 
            us better understand the way the slugs use their environment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once you have recorded your data, a list of the records will be displayed here. You can also 
            switch to see the records displayed on a map view using the tab buttons above. Click on a record 
            in the list to continue editing that record.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Uploading Records
        </h2>
        <p>
            When one or more records have been completed, you can upload them to the server by clicking the 
            upload button. Completed records (shown in green) are those where all required fields are entered 
            and within the allowable constraints. You can still upload completed records even if some are 
            incomplete (shown in blue). Incomplete records will not be uploaded.
        </p>
        <button class="fab-button" (click)="uploadClicked()">
            <img class="fab-button__img" src="assets/imgs/fab-upload.png">
            <span class="fab-button__text">Upload data</span>
        </button>

        <h2>GPS accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            The accuracy of the GPS in your device will improve over time after it
            has been started as it picks up signals from more satellites. You may wish to
            update the location information in your observation or census periodically if the current accuracy is
            insufficient. This can be done by pressing the "{{UPDATE_BUTTON_NAME}}" button within a record form.
