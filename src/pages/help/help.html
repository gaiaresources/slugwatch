            To get started, go to the ‘Records’ screen and choose the button below to record an observation.
            An observation is a one-off recording of a giant pink slug sighting at a particular location.
        <p>

        <button class="fab-button" (click)="onClickedNewRecord(DATASETNAME_OBSERVATION)">
            <img class="fab-button__img" src="assets/imgs/fab-eye.png" alt="Koala Opportunistic Observation">
            <span class="fab-button__text">Record an observation</span>
        </button>

        <p>
            For each observation, please detail the type of observation, whether it is an observation of
            one or more animals or sign of the animal’s presence from the distinctive trail marks left on smooth barked eucalypts.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            For observations where you have multiple slugs on different substrates, please record a separate
            observation for each substrate type (tree trunk, road, leaf litter, rock, etc.).
            This will help us better understand the way the slugs use their environment
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have recorded your data, a list of the records will be displayed here.
            You can also switch to see the records displayed on a map view using the tab buttons above.
            Click on a record in the list to continue editing that record.

        </p>

            Uploading Records
        </h2>
        <p>
            When one or more records have been completed, you can upload them to the server by clicking the upload button.
            Completed records (shown in green and identified with a C) are those where all required fields are entered
            and within the allowable constraints. You can still upload completed records even if some are incomplete
            (shown in blue and identified with an I). Incomplete records will not be uploaded.
        </p>
        <button class="fab-button" (click)="uploadClicked()">

        </button>

        <h2>GPS accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            The accuracy of the GPS in your device will improve over time after it has been started as it picks up
            signals from more satellites. If you wish to update the location information in your observation press
            the ‘Use Current Location’ button within a record form.
