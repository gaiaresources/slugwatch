        <h1>{{APP_NAME}}</h1>

        <p>
            {{APP_NAME}} was developed in 2019 by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for the
            collection of observation data for snails and slugs within Mount Kaputar National Park and adjacent 
            Nandewar Ranges within NSW.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Mount Kaputar Land Snail and Slug Threatened Ecological Community is an assemblage of at 
            least 20 species of native land snails and 1 slug known from high elevation and dry rainforests 
            of the Mount Kaputar region. The Giant Pink Slug (Triboniophorus aff. graeffei) is a locally endemic 
            species and the most obvious and commonly seen member of this ecological community. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The {{APP_NAME}} app is designed to record sightings of the Giant Pink Slug within the Mount Kaputar National Park 
            and adjacent Nandewar Ranges within NSW. In future the app will also allow users to record sightings of the two 
            most commonly encountered snail species. Data collected using this app will help environmental managers, 
            land managers and the community about the distribution and habitat for this threatened ecological community, 
            and assists the implementation of long term conservation strategies. 
        </p>

        <p>
            All data submitted via this app is made available by OEH though BioNet, NSW’s corporate biodiversity data
            repository. BioNet data is accessible to researchers, land managers, government agencies and the public via
            the <a href="https://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au">BioNet website</a>
            and the <a href="https://www.seed.nsw.gov.au/">OEH SEED portal</a>.
