        <h1 style="text-align:center">SAVING OUR SPECIES</h1>
        <h1>{{APP_NAME}}</h1>

        <p>
            {{APP_NAME}} was developed in 2019 as part of the Saving our Species program for the collection
            of observation data for snails and slugs within Mount Kaputar National Park and adjacent Nandewar Ranges within NSW.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Mount Kaputar Land Snail and Slug Threatened Ecological Community is an assemblage of at least 20 species
            of native land snails and 1 slug known from high elevation and dry rainforests of the Mount Kaputar region.
            The giant pink slug (<i>Triboniophorussp.</i> nov. “Kaputar”  ) is a locally endemic species and the most obvious and
            commonly seen member of this ecological community.
        </p>

        <p>
            The {{APP_NAME}}  app is designed to record sightings of the giant pink slug within the Mount Kaputar National Park
            and adjacent Nandewar Ranges within NSW. Data collected using this app will help environmental managers, land managers
            and the community about the distribution and habitat for this threatened ecological community and assists the
            implementation of long-term conservation strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            All data submitted via this app is made available through BioNet, NSW’s corporate biodiversity data repository.
            BioNet data is accessible to researchers, land managers, government agencies and the public via
            the <a href="https://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/">BioNet website</a>
            and the <a href="https://www.seed.nsw.gov.au/">SEED portal</a>.

        <h1>Saving our Species</h1>

        <p>
            Saving our Species is a NSW Government program targeting on-ground action to secure threatened plants
            and animals from extinction. The program aims to increase the number of threatened species that can
            survive securely in the wild.
        </p>

        <p>
            Saving our Species can only succeed if we work together. We need your support to ensure that today’s
            actions help to secure the future of NSW’s threatened species.
        </p>
